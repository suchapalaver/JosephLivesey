## About me    

I recently completed my PhD in anthropology, a culmination of years learning about and living in China, Russia, and Ukraine. Now, while continuing to be inspired by those experiences and that training, I want to pursue a career allowing me to continue to learn programming languages.    

### programming    

When I finished my PhD I wanted to try something different. A friend suggested trying using Linux and learning a programming language or two. I'd never thought how similar studying languages, like Chinese and Ukrainian, could be to learning programming languages like Python and Rust. I found the same kind of passion again that got me started with Chinese and Russian twenty years ago. Now I just want to keep learning.    

### git    

I only read CBEAMS's ["How to Write a Git Commit Message"](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) for the first time around Feb/March 2022!   

Lately, in my [`newsletter`](https://github.com/suchapalaver/newsletter) repository I've been meticulously working through [Luca Palmieri](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker)'s [Zero To Production In Rust](https://www.zero2prod.com/), and I'm looking forward to implementing my `grusterylist` CLI app as an async web app with proper logging and testing.    

[`krust`](https://github.com/suchapalaver/krust) and [`grusterylist`](https://github.com/suchapalaver/grusterylist) are my first two programs in Rust that I'm continuing to work on.     

My bioinformatician friend Erik who mentored me into starting to code suggested learning to write a k-mer counter as a good first project to learn Python. [`fastas2kmers`](https://github.com/suchapalaver/fastas2kmers) is that very rough first attempt. [`krust`](https://github.com/suchapalaver/krust) was the first program I wrote in Rust, using [`rayon`](https://crates.io/crates/rayon) to count k-mers in parallel.   

My wife and I use [`grusterylist`](https://github.com/suchapalaver/grusterylist) every week to save time on putting our shopping lists together. It seemed like a boring idea at first but it gave me the chance to create my own data types, figure out how to use the Rust crates [`clap`](https://crates.io/crates/clap) and [`serde`](https://crates.io/crates/serde) for the first time, and have a go at customized error handling. I don't think there are many beginner hobby project examples in Rust out there.

### filmmaking

Part of my degree at NYU consisted of a program called **Culture and Media** that combined Cinema Studies and Anthropological approaches to documentary. I would love to take up some of the ideas in these very provisional rough projects again.    

[Letter From 49th St](https://youtu.be/IGGbIMNZnAA) is unfinished but sketches out some ideas for how one might try to make a different kind of discussion around gentrification. At the time I was living on 49th Street in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. [Gentrifying Sunset Park](https://youtu.be/CF3yfkleAow) was an even heavier-handed attempt at using essay-inspired approaches to making a film about the neighborhood I lived in.   

[The Fish Ball Chef on 8th Ave](https://youtu.be/CFG-Up1gzw4) was the first film I ever made, about the experience of immigrating from Fujian to New York.
