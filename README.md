# Joseph Livesey
## About me    

I am a backend software engineer at [BTP](https://btp.works/) working on [Chronicle](github.com/btpworks/chronicle), an open-source, blockchain-backed, platform for recording [provenance information](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/). 

I completed my PhD in Sociocultural Anthropology at New York University in 2021, a culmination of twenty years learning about and living in China, Russia, and Ukraine, including graduating from the AM program in Russian, East European, and Central Asian Studies at Harvard University in 2011, as well as many other travels in East Asia and the Former Soviet Union. 

I continue to be inspired by those experiences and that training while growing into a career allowing me to continue to learn programming languages, including Rust and TypeScript, frameworks, like GraphQL, DevOps tools like Docker and Kubernetes, and the many commercial and social domains applicable to the work on provenance we do at [BTP](https://btp.works/) with [Chronicle](https://medium.com/btpworks/introducing-chronicle-blockchain-backed-provenance-2ee352f718fa).    

### programming    

When I finished my PhD I wanted to try something different. A friend suggested trying using Linux and learning a programming language or two. I'd never thought how similar studying languages, like Chinese and Ukrainian, could be to learning programming languages like Python and Rust. I found the same kind of passion again that got me started with Chinese and Russian twenty years ago. Now I just want to keep learning.    

### `git`  

[`krust`](https://github.com/suchapalaver/krust) and [`grusterylist`](https://github.com/suchapalaver/grusterylist) are my first two programs in Rust that I'm continuing to work on, applying what I learn at work as I go.

My bioinformatician friend Erik who mentored me into starting to code suggested learning to write a k-mer counter as a good first project to learn Python. [`fastas2kmers`](https://github.com/suchapalaver/fastas2kmers) is that very rough first attempt. [`krust`](https://github.com/suchapalaver/krust) was the first program I wrote in Rust, using [`rayon`](https://crates.io/crates/rayon) to count k-mers in parallel.   

My wife and I use [`grusterylist`](https://github.com/suchapalaver/grusterylist) every week to save time on putting our shopping lists together. It seemed like a boring idea at first but it gave me the chance to create my own data types, figure out how to use the Rust crates [`clap`](https://crates.io/crates/clap) and [`serde`](https://crates.io/crates/serde) for the first time, and have a go at customized error handling.

### filmmaking

Part of my degree at NYU consisted of a program called **Culture and Media** that combined Cinema Studies and Anthropological approaches to documentary. I would love to take up some of the ideas in these very provisional rough projects again.    

[Letter From 49th St](https://youtu.be/IGGbIMNZnAA) is unfinished but sketches out some ideas for how one might try to make a different kind of discussion around gentrification. At the time I was living on 49th Street in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. [Gentrifying Sunset Park](https://youtu.be/CF3yfkleAow) was an even heavier-handed attempt at using essay-inspired approaches to making a film about the neighborhood I lived in.   

[The Fish Ball Chef on 8th Ave](https://youtu.be/CFG-Up1gzw4) was the first film I ever made, about the experience of immigrating from Fujian to New York.
