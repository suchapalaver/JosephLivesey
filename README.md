### About me    
I only read CBEAMS's ["How to Write a Git Commit Message"](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) for the first time around Feb/March 2022!    

`krust` and `grusterylist` are my first two programs in Rust and the best places to look to see where I'm at in my learning.     

My bioinformatician friend Erik who mentored me into starting to code suggested learning to write a k-mer counter as a good first project to learn Python. `fastas2kmers` is that very rough first attempt. `krust` was the first program I wrote in Rust, allowing me to learn to use `rayon` to count k-mers in parallel.   

My wife and I use `grusterylist` every week to save time on putting our shopping lists together. It seemed like a boring idea at first but it gave the chance to create my own data types, figure out how to use the Rust crates `clap` and `serde` for the first time, and have a go at customized error handling.
